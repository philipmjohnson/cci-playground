# Python

The py/ subdirectory supports a Python solution and unit tests.

## 1. Python Installation

You must have python installed on your computer. Most operating systems come with python installed. 

## 2. Create a PyCharm Project

Create a new Project in PyCharm, pointing it at the py/ directory:

Once the project is created, the IsUnique.py file will display similar to this:

## 3. Run the Tests

A nice way to develop your solutions is to write a set of tests to check that your code performs as expected. The file test_IsUnique.py provides a couple of simple tests of the IsUnique solution:

Clicking a green arrow in the gutter allows you to run one or more unit tests. Here's what it looks like after a successful run:

## 4. Everything from the command-line?

Of course you can do everything from the command line:

```
% cd py
% python test_IsUnique.py 
  ....
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 4 tests in 0.000s
  
  OK
```
