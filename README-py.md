# Python

The py/ subdirectory supports a Python solution and unit tests.

## 1. Python Installation

You must have python installed on your computer. Most operating systems come with python installed. 

## 2. Create a PyCharm Project

Set up a project that points to the py/ directory in your IDE (File --> New Project). Then open the IsUnique.py file. It should look like this in PyCharm:

## 3. Run the Tests

A nice way to develop your solutions is to write a set of tests to check that your code performs as expected. The file test_IsUnique.py provides a couple of simple tests of the IsUnique solution. You can run the tests from PyCharm by right clicking on test_IsUnique.py in the top right, then selecting or selecting "Run 
\'test_IsUnique\'". 

```

## 4. Everything from the command-line?

Of course you can do everything from the command line:

```
% cd py
% python test_IsUnique.py
```
